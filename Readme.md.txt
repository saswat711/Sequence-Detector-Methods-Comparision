##The result of the comparissions:

❖ The Moore method of designing the sequence detector have higher hardware requirement than that of mealy.
❖ More no. of states is required in Moore method. They react slower to inputs. Moore method also have synchronous output and state generation.
❖ Less no. of states is required in mealy method. They react faster to inputs. Mealy method also has asynchronous output generation.
❖ The over-lapping and Non over-lapping methods doesn’t affect the performance or resources requirement much.
❖ As the no. of bits to be detected in a sequence detector increases so as the resources requirement also.
❖ The mealy overlap method-based detector consumes 0.202 W power. It uses 4 Lut, 3 FLOP LATCH, 4 IO AND 1 CLOCK. The mealy non-overlap method-based detector consumes 0.201 W power. It uses It uses 4 Lut, 3 FLOP LATCH, 4 IO AND 1 CLOCK. The moore overlap method-based detector consumes 0.145 W power. It uses 7 Lut, 8 FLOP LATCH, 4 IO AND 1 CLOCK. The moore non-overlap method based detector consumes 0.144 W power. It uses 7 Lut, 8 FLOP LATCH, 4 IO AND 1 CLOCK.
❖ The power consumption in moore method is less than that of mealy based method. Whereas no of lut and flip-flops used are more.
